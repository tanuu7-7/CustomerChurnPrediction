# Customer Churn Prediction

A machine learning model to predict customer churn based on demographic and service usage data. This project uses data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and a Random Forest model to classify churn.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains dataset files (if permissible to share).
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with data analysis and model building steps.
- `results/`: Model results and evaluation metrics.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Open `notebooks/churn_prediction.ipynb` for a full walkthrough of the analysis.

## Results
- **Accuracy**: 82.115%
- **Cross-validated F1 score**: 0.598
